1st, we have to create astro project with npm or pnpm

```bash
npm create astro@latest --template minimal
```
or
```bash
pnpm create astro@latest --template minimal
```

<Image src={projectTerminal} alt="" />
then name it as `<username>.github.io`
<Image src={terminalFinished} alt="" />
after that install dependencies? Yes  
Initialize a new git repository? No (We'll do it later)  
Edit `astro.config.mjs` site in defineConfig
```js
defineConfig({
  site: "https://<username>.github.io",
});
```
after finished create project head to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository  
<Image src={createRepository} alt="" />
we have to named it as same as our project name which mean `<username>.github.io`
<Image src={createdRepository} alt="" />
now we'll get commands that we can use to push our project to GitHub  
now open our created project with vscode or access it with terminal
then enter the command
```bash
git init
git commit -m "Comment"
git add .
```
then enter the command that we got from GitHub
<Image src={projectToGitHub} alt="" />
it will deploy our project to github.io but it's not correct one
<Image src={githubioView} alt="" />
so we have to add `deploy.yml` in `.github/workflows` directory
```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout your repository using git
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install, build, and upload your site
        uses: withastro/action@v3

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```
but after we push our script has an error because we use pnpm
<Image src={errorWorkflows} alt="" />
so we have to fix it by add version to our yml
```yaml
- name: Install, build, and upload your site
  uses: withastro/action@v3
  with:
    package-manager: pnpm@latest
```
but before we push it to github we have to change source of pages from branch to GitHub Actions
<Image src={changeDeploy} alt="" />
after that we can push the fix to GitHub and it should success run workflows with our page on GitHub Pages
<Image src={successWorkflows} alt="" />
<Image src={finishedioView} alt="" />
